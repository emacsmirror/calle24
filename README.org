* Calle 24 - Proxy Emacs image assets with SF Symbols

Use [[https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/][SF Symbols]] in place of the default toolbar images packaged with Emacs (NS variant).

** Caveats
- This work is intended for use only on Emacs for macOS. This package does not support other platforms.

* Features
- Basic set of Emacs image assets are proxied.
- Support for light and dark OS appearance.

* Known Issues
- Not all Emacs image assets are proxied.
  - Low color and monochrome image assets are not covered.
    
* How Does This Work?
By convention, Emacs tool bar code references an image file by doing a path-list search with the /basename/ part of the image file name. The path-list is specified by the variable ~image-load-path~. The /basename/ is treated as a pseudo-logical reference key.

*Calle 24* takes advantage of this by recreating the same directory of image file names packaged by Emacs but instead using SF Symbol data as the image file content. The path to this directory is then inserted at the start of the ~image-load-path~ variable. When the tool bar code looks for an image, it will pick up the directory containing SF symbols data first and render it accordingly.

* Requirements

*Calle 24* requires Emacs 29.1+ running on macOS.

* Installation

The *Calle 24* package (~calle24~) is distributed on [[https://melpa.org/#/calle24][MELPA]]. Use your package manager of choice to install it.

Upon installation or subsequent updates of ~calle24~ from MELPA, run the following command:

#+begin_src elisp
  M-x calle24-install
#+end_src

You should restart Emacs after running the above command to see the tool bar images replaced with their SF Symbols equivalent.



** Configuration

Add the following code to your Emacs initialization to load appearance-specific images.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (calle24-refresh-appearance)
  (add-hook 'compilation-mode-hook #'calle24-refresh-appearance)
#+end_src

** Uninstall

In the event that you do not wish to use *Calle 24*, perform the following
steps before deleting the ~calle24~ package.

In the event that you do not wish to use *Calle 24*, perform the following command:

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  M-x calle24-uninstall
#+end_src

This command will do the following:

1. Remove the directory ~calle24-image-directory~ in ~user-emacs-directory~.
2. Remove ~calle24-image-directory~ from ~image-load-path~.

** Troubleshooting

The ~calle24-install~ command uses your local install of ~rsync~ to install the image files. There have been reports of Homebrew builds not successfully running ~calle24-install~ using the default macOS install of ~rsync~. A workaround is to install the Homebrew version of ~rsync~ which should navigate the required permissions to successfully install.

* Using Calle 24

If you use "light" mode always, there's really nothing needed to do. However if you have your appearance mode on /auto/ then tool bar images will need to change with respect to the current appearance.

This can be controlled by calling the command ~calle24-refresh-appearance~ upon appearance change.

Explicit invocation of appearance can be done with the following commands:

- ~calle24-light-appearance~
- ~calle24-dark-appearance~

* Why the name Calle 24?

As SF Symbols references San Francisco, [[https://www.calle24sf.org][Calle 24]] references 24th Street in the Mission District of San Francisco. It also happens to be the gathering place for the [[https://www.meetup.com/Emacs-SF/][Emacs SF meetup]].
